		Consent Form <br>
	   CENTRAL CONNECTICUT STATE UNIVERSITY<br>
        Department of Psychology<br>
        1615 Stanley Street New Britain, CT 06050 <br><br>
        Predictive Language Algorithm Improvement<br>
        Principal Investigator -Schuyler Dragoo, Graduate Student Researcher (sdragoo@my.ccsu.edu)<br>
        Faculty supervisor: Dr. John Protzko (protzko@ccsu.edu)<br><br>
		  <b> 1. This study will contribute to the graduate psychology coursework and thesis for Schuyler Dragoo at CCSU. <br>
		  </b>This study aims to examine and improve a language prediction algorithm that we are developing. To further our understanding of this topic, we are asking you to participate in this study. <b><br><br>
		  2. If you participate in this study, you will be asked to: </b> <br>
		  •	Fill in words to test and improve our language prediction algorithm<br>
        • Write brief open-ended responses to provided questions <b> <br><br>
		  3. Risks and Inconveniences: </b> <br>
		  •	There are no major foreseeable risks to taking part in this study. As with any study or information transmitted via the internet, there is a small chance that your data could be compromised. However, we will do our best to protect you from any such risks and no information you provide will be sensitive/ potentially damaging. All questions we ask are relatively mundane in nature. Your responses will not be shared with any outside parties. There will be no identifiable information mentioned in any analyses or reports that contain your data; results are usually generalized across all participants and data are anonymous. At any time, only the researchers will have access to any identifiable data. <b> <br><br>
		  4. Benefits </b> <br>
		  •	This study was not designed to benefit you directly, however, there is some possibility that you may learn about memory and learn new words through your participation. In addition, what we learn from the study may help us to better understand memory and language predictive algorithms. <b><br><br>
		  5. Financial (or other) Considerations: </b><br>
		  •	Survey respondents will be paid via Amazon Mechanical Turk. <br><br>
		  <b> 6. Confidentiality: </b> <br>
		  •	Any and all information obtained from you during the study will be confidential. Your privacy will be protected at all times. You will not be identified individually in any way as a result of your participation in this research. The data collected however, may be used as part of publications and papers related to memory and language prediction algorithms. Participation will be anonymous. <br><br>
		  <b> 7. Voluntary Participation: </b> <br>
		  •	Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You may refuse to participate in this research. Such refusal will not have any negative consequences for you. If you begin to participate in the research, you may at any time, for any reason, discontinue your participation without any negative consequences. <b><br><br> 8. Other considerations and questions: </b><br>
		  •	This research is funded by a grant from Central Connecticut State University and has been reviewed by the CCSU Psychology Ethics Committee. <br>
		  
        •	Please feel free to ask any questions about anything that seems unclear to you and to consider this research and consent form carefully before you sign. <br><br>
		  <b> Authorization: </b> <br>
		  I have read or listened to the above information and I have decided that I will participate in the project described above.The researcher has explained the study to me and answered my questions. I know what will be asked of me. I understand that the purpose of the study is to understand memory and predictive text. If I don't participate, there will be no penalty or loss of rights. I can stop participating at any time, even after I have
        started. 
        
        I agree to participate in the study. My agreement below also indicates that I have received a copy of this consent form. My consent is also implied from the completion and submission of this survey. </p>
